# To-Do App 

## Project Overview

This application is a Django-based ToDo list.

The app allows users to:
- Create, view, edit, complete, and delete tasks.
- Manage subtasks linked to parent tasks.
- Add new tasks directly through the application.

This acts as a MVP for the first epic with the addition of interface task addition.

Each feature has an automated test to go with it as a result of the TDD cycles.

## Setup
- Clone the repo via Bash.
- Create a virtual enviorment to isolate the dependencies.
- Install said dependencies.
- Run the migrations for syncing.
- Run test to ensure everything is working as intended.
- Then, run the server.

### Notes and To Do
- Subtasks cannot be added through the interface. This will be added in a second sprint.
- I plan to add task descriptions and the likes in a future sprint.
